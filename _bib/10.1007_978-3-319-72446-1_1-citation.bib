abstract="This introductory chapter outlines the social bases related to drug use. First, the parallel between capitalist development and the commercial exploitation of drug use is discussed, demonstrating how, historically, such substances were an important source of capital and the reason for exploration of certain territories. Next, it is shown how moral codes have been created that bind certain groups to some substances, consequently legitimizing processes of punishment and oppression against those groups. Moreover, within the modern model of society based on consumption, the logic of the citizen-consumer is described, as well as the processes of separation between those who have access to this benefit and those that do not. This also creates a differentiation between drugs whose use is encouraged and drugs related to certain groups and, therefore, prohibited by the State. Finally, attention is drawn to the importance of understanding macrosocial factors and social determinants related to drug use.",
