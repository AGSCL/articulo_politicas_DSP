    abstract = { News consumption has been dramatically altered by the rise of social media. The current study examines the international news section of Google News by looking at the frequency and valence of coverage of other nations. News headlines and snippets about various countries are compared to public perceptions, in order to assess the agenda set by the most popular online news aggregator: Google. The public agenda is based on a dedicated survey. Study results provide qualified support for a framework derived from agenda setting theory. In particular, systems-level variables--such as a nationâ€˜s political philosophy and perceived cultural proximity--influence media agenda-setting. }
